# CtkConsumer

The CtkConsumer sample demonstrates the use of keys accessed via a Persistent Token Extension via inclusion of com.apple.token in the app's entitlements file and use of basic KeyChain API calls to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt. This can be used in tandem with the CtkProvider app.

Bundle identifiers need to be updated to reflect bundle identifiers associated with the signer. These include:

Bundle Identifier for CtkConsumer  
keychain-access-groups for CtkConsumer
